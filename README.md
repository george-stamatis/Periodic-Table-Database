# Periodic Table Database

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum for the "Relational Database" certification. It involves the development of a PostgreSQL database named "periodic_table" and a corresponding Bash script to interact with it. The database stores information about chemical elements, including their atomic number, symbol, name, atomic mass, melting point, boiling point, and type. The Bash script allows users to query the database using an element's atomic number, symbol, or name and retrieve relevant information.

# Project Description

The Periodic Table Database project aims to create a comprehensive database of chemical elements and provide a user-friendly interface for querying element information. Inspired by the need for organized and accessible chemical data, this project focuses on structuring a PostgreSQL database and developing a Bash script to interact with it efficiently.

# Key Aspects

- Database Creation: Set up a PostgreSQL database named "periodic_table" to store information about chemical elements.

- Database Schema Design: Design a database schema with tables for elements, properties, and types, ensuring accurate representation of element attributes and relationships.

- Data Population: Populate the database with initial data, including details about chemical elements such as atomic number, symbol, name, atomic mass, melting point, boiling point, and type.

- Bash Script Development: Develop a Bash script that accepts an argument in the form of an atomic number, symbol, or name of an element and outputs relevant information about the specified element.

- User Interaction: Create a user-friendly interface for the Bash script, guiding users through the process of querying element information and providing informative output.

- Error Handling: Implement proper error handling in the Bash script to handle invalid inputs and ensure smooth execution.
